# Startup Sportvill

This is a Java CRUD project developed during my IT course to learn how to create, update, and query data and handle exceptions.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Java installed on your computer. You can download and install Java from the official website at https://www.java.com/en/download/.

## What is a CRUD?
CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. It is a basic set of operations that can be performed on any database. In a CRUD operation, data is created, retrieved, updated, and deleted.

## How it works
This Java CRUD project allows you to perform CRUD operations on a database. It uses JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to connect to the database and perform operations.

To run this project, you need to have a MySQL database installed on your computer. You can download and install MySQL from the official website at https://www.mysql.com/downloads/.

Once you have Java and MySQL installed, you can clone this project to your local machine and import it into your Java IDE.

To run the project, simply run the Main class. You will be prompted to enter the details of the product you want to create, update, or delete. The program will handle exceptions that may occur during the CRUD operations.
